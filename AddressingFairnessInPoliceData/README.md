FairnessInML_2021 jupyter notebook is where I have all my codes implemented. 
The metropolitan police dataset is 74mb too large for GitHub, but I have included a link to download it in the codes.
Kindly click on the link provided to access the dataset.
I have also added the python executable code.

Packages and the version that may be required to run the code:
aif360
scikit-learn 0.24.1 
matplotlib 3.3.4
numpy 1.19.2
pandas 1.2.3
